The OnDemand module provides an "OnDemand" realm in XDMoD.
This OnDemand realm displays information about usage of Open OnDemand
from the web server logs.

The default permission is that user accounts with center director and center
staff role have full access to the OnDemand realm. Other accounts and the
public user will not see the realm.

This module also adds a chart to the Dashboard for center director and center
staff accounts.
