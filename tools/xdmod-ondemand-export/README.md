# xdmod-ondemand-export

Python script for parsing [Open OnDemand](https://openondemand.org/) Apache
access logs and sending them via POST requests to an HTTPS endpoint on a web
server for inclusion in [XDMoD](https://open.xdmod.org). It also sends lists of
installed Open OnDemand apps for inventory by the Open OnDemand team.

## Obtain an API token

Obtain an API token from the admins of the destination web server; for ACCESS
XDMoD, this is done by [submitting a
ticket](https://support.access-ci.org/open-a-ticket):
- For the "Summary" and "Description" you can say "Requesting
  xdmod-ondemand-export API token for [resource name]."
- For "ACCESS Support Issue," choose "XDMoD Question."

## Installation

The steps below explain the recommended setup, to be run as root on the system
that has the Open OnDemand Apache access log files and lists of Open OnDemand
apps (the latter in `/var/www/ood/apps`). The steps will create a new user
called `xdmod-ondemand-export` with no shell or login access but which has
read-only access to the logs (e.g., via Access Control List), install the
Python package, and set up the files and permissions needed for the script to
run.

### Create the `xdmod-ondemand-export` user with no shell or login access

```
useradd -m --shell /bin/false xdmod-ondemand-export
usermod -L xdmod-ondemand-export
```

### Install the package to a directory

The package is installed to a directory so that updates of the system Python
will not break the script (since pip otherwise separates packages by major
Python version and does not automatically migrate them to new versions).
```
su -c 'python3 -m pip install --target /home/xdmod-ondemand-export/xdmod-ondemand-export xdmod-ondemand-export' -s /bin/bash xdmod-ondemand-export
```

### Copy the `conf.ini` configuration file to the user's home directory with read-only permissions

```
(umask 377 && cp /home/xdmod-ondemand-export/xdmod-ondemand-export/xdmod_ondemand_export/conf.ini /home/xdmod-ondemand-export/)
```

### Edit the configuration file

Edit `/home/xdmod-ondemand-export/conf.ini` to change the default values to
match your system. The defaults assume:
- The logs are located at `/etc/httpd/logs`.
- The files to process match the filename pattern `*access*.log`.
- The LogFormat of the files is the Combined Log Format,
  `%h %l %u %t "%r" %>s %b "%{Referer}i" "%{User-Agent}i"`.

### Store the API token in the token file

Create an initially empty token file with read and write permissions (in
addition to storing the token, the file will be edited by the script to create
a secret key used for hashing IP addresses):
```
(umask 177 && touch /home/xdmod-ondemand-export/.token)
```
Edit the token file (`/home/xdmod-ondemand-export/.token`) to add the token
string to the file.

### Create the JSON file

The JSON file is used by the script as it runs to keep track of which files
have been processed already. Create an initially empty JSON file with read and
write permissions:
```
(umask 177 && touch /home/xdmod-ondemand-export/last-run.json)
```

### Change file ownership of the three files so the user can access them

```
chown xdmod-ondemand-export:xdmod-ondemand-export /home/xdmod-ondemand-export/{conf.ini,.token,last-run.json}
```

### Allow the user to read all current and future log files

The user running the script needs read permissions on the log files. The
commands below do this by setting up Access Control Lists for the logs
directory and the files in it. Make sure to replace `/etc/httpd/logs` with the
location of your logs directory if it is different. If you are on Ubuntu and do
not have the `setfacl` command, you may need to run `apt install acl` first.
```
setfacl -m u:xdmod-ondemand-export:r-x /etc/httpd/logs   # allow the user to traverse the logs directory
setfacl -m u:xdmod-ondemand-export:r-- /etc/httpd/logs/* # allow the user to read the current log files
setfacl -dm u:xdmod-ondemand-export:r-- /etc/httpd/logs  # allow the user to read future log files
```

### Check the configuration

Run the Python script in check-config mode to make sure there are no warnings
or errors; this will check file permissions and parse the configuration file,
token file, and JSON file. It will detect whether there are any logs to
process, but it will not attempt to parse or POST any of them.
```
su -c 'PYTHONENV=$PYTHONENV:/home/xdmod-ondemand-export/xdmod-ondemand-export /home/xdmod-ondemand-export/xdmod-ondemand-export/bin/xdmod-ondemand-export --check-config -l INFO' -s /bin/bash xdmod-ondemand-export
```
If this is your first time running the script, and it says there are no logs to
process, check to make sure the values in the configuration file
(`/home/xdmod-ondemand-export/conf.ini`) for `dir` and `filename_pattern` are
correct.

### Create a cron job to run the script daily

Open the user's crontab:
```
su -c 'crontab -e' -s /bin/bash xdmod-ondemand-export
```
Add the following line. This will set up the script to run daily at 2:01am.
```
1 2 * * * PYTHONENV=$PYTHONENV:/home/xdmod-ondemand-export/xdmod-ondemand-export /home/xdmod-ondemand-export/xdmod-ondemand-export/bin/xdmod-ondemand-export
```

## Upgrading the script

The script can be upgraded to the latest version by running:
```
su -c 'python3 -m pip install --upgrade --target /home/xdmod-ondemand-export/xdmod-ondemand-export xdmod-ondemand-export' -s /bin/bash xdmod-ondemand-export
```

### If you are upgrading from version 1.0.0

If you are upgrading from version 1.0.0, before the next run of the script, add
write permission to the token file so it can be edited by the script to create
a secret key used for hashing IP addresses:
```
chmod 600 /home/xdmod-ondemand-export/.token
```

## Troubleshooting

The `xdmod-ondemand-export` command can be run manually:
```
su -c 'PYTHONENV=$PYTHONENV:/home/xdmod-ondemand-export/xdmod-ondemand-export /home/xdmod-ondemand-export/xdmod-ondemand-export/bin/xdmod-ondemand-export' -s /bin/bash xdmod-ondemand-export
```

The command can be run with any of the following log levels by including the
`-l` or `--log-level` option:
* `DEBUG`
* `INFO`
* `WARNING` (the default)
* `ERROR`

You can place the configuration file, token file, and JSON file at arbitrary
locations on the filesystem. If you do this, include the relevant option(s)
when running the script:
* `-c` or `--conf-path` followed by the path to the configuration file.
* `-t` or `--token-path` followed by the path to the token file.
* `-j` or `--json-path` followed by the path to the JSON file.

You can get the version number of the script by including the `--version`
option.

The JSON file (`last-run.json`) works by storing the filename, first line, file
size, and last line of each log file that is successfully parsed and POSTed.
When the script runs, it uses the values in the configuration file
(`conf.ini`), specifically `dir` and `filename_pattern`, to figure out which
log files to process. The script will process those log files as follows:
* If the first line and file size of the log file match an entry in the JSON
  file, the log file will not be parsed, but its filename will be updated in
  the JSON file.
* If the first line of the log file matches an entry in the JSON file but its
  file size is different, the log file will be parsed and POSTed starting at
  the line immediately after the last line stored in the JSON file. The
  filename, file size, and last successfully-POSTed line will be updated in the
  JSON file.
* If the first line of the log file does not match an entry in the JSON file,
  the entire log file will be parsed and POSTed, and a new entry will be added
  to the JSON file.
* For any entries in the JSON file for which the script does not encounter a
  log file whose first line matches, those files are assumed to be deleted, and
  their entries are removed from the JSON file.

You can edit the JSON file to force certain log files to be processed; e.g., if
a file has an entry in the JSON file but you want it to be parsed and POSTed
again, just delete its entry in the JSON file before the next run of the
script.
